I feel that a growth mindset is the key to success. A growth mindset is a mindset that someone who is able to learn and grow has. Instead of being or feeling limited to natural abilities or intelligence, a growth mindset pushes a person to grow and develop in the face of adversity and obstacles instead of falling down and giving up.

Here are a couple traits that people with a growth mindset tend to have.

-Effort- This is obviously important when faced with an obstacle or hurdle it is important to not give up effort and focus.

-Attention- It is important to not lose focus if faced with something tough or challenging. Instead of giving up and doing something easier, it is important to remind yourself that even the best coders struggled at first too.

-Perseverance- This is a really important one. Everyone that tries to code is going to become frustrated and that frustration is what needs to be watched. Learning how to handle criticism, even if it is self criticism is very important when attempting to learn new things.
