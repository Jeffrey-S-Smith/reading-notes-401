[react hello world](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html)

1. What are the building blocks of a React app?
  props. StateLess Components. StateFull Components. Lifecycle methods of a component.
  
2. What is the difference between an element and a React component?
  A React element is an object representation of a DOM node. A component encapsulates a DOM tree. Elements are immutable i,e once created cannot be changed. The state in a component is mutable.

3. What are some advantages of Reactâ€™s component based architecture?
  It helps the developers create quick and single-page applications and interfaces. React is a component-based library created by Facebook. It creates different user interfaces and manages different component states. Multiple components and tools can make complex applications without losing the state in DOM.

[introducing JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

1. What is JSX and why do we use it?
2. Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.
3. Is it safe to embed user input in JSX? Explain.

[rendering elements](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/rendering-elements.html)

1. Explain what a React Component is to a non-technical friend.
  JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code). It is easy to create a template using JSX in React, but it is not a simple template language instead it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

2. Describe mutability and React Components, specifically, how is the UI updated?
  React lets you define components as classes or functions. Components define

3. If changes are made to the UI, what does React update?
  React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props. A simple update of the state, from anywhere in the code, causes all the User Interface (UI) elements to be re-rendered automatically. However, there may be cases where the render() method depends on some other data.
