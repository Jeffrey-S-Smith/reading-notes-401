[An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
    Middleware is software which lies between an operating system and the applications running on it. Essentially functioning as hidden translation layer, middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications.

2. Express the most popular **\_\_** **\_\_** **\_\_**_\_\__.

3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
    It means there is no one right way to do things that Express will force you into.

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
    What is modularity explain the importance of modularity?
    Software modularity indicates that the number of application modules are capable of serving a specified business domain. Modularity is successful because developers use prewritten code, which saves resources. Overall, modularity provides greater software development manageability.

[What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
    8.19.1
2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
  npm install jshint

[What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
    Writing Minimal Code, Getting Rid Of Regression Bug, Building Confidence In Your Code.

2. What are three expected benefits of testing
    * More understanding. Formative assessment provides valuable data on students' abilities, performance, and engagement. ...
    * More motivation. ...
    * More support. ...
    * More student progress.

3. Name at least 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
  2 individual pitfalls
    * Lack of requirements documentation.
    * Unstable environment.
  2 team pitfalls 
    * Maintaining Good Quality consistently over time
    * Centralized knowledge and expertise

[CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
    Continuous integration (CI) makes software development easier, faster, and less risky for developers. By automating builds and tests, developers can make smaller changes and commit them with confidence. Developers get feedback on their code sooner, increasing the overall pace of innovation.

2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
    Continuous Delivery is the automation of steps to safely get changes into production. Where Continuous Deployment focuses on the actual deployment, Continuous Delivery focuses on the release and release strategy

3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
    Once your pull request is approved, merge your pull request. This will automatically merge your branch so that your changes appear on the default branch. GitHub retains the history of comments and commits in the pull request to help future contributors understand your changes.
