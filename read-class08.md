[5 steps to RBAC](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3060780/security/5-steps-to-simple-role-based-access-control.html)

1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
    Security: RBAC improves overall security as it relates to compliance, confidentiality, privacy, and access management to resources and other sensitive data and systems. Selective access: RBAC systems can support users having multiple roles at the same with specific permissions for each role.

2. Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.
    ole-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security paradigm whereby users are granted access to resources based on their role in the company. RBAC, if implemented correctly, can be an effective way of enforcing the principle of least privilege.

3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
    * Inventory your systems. Figure out what resources you have for which you need to control access, if you don't already have them listed. ...
    * Analyze your workforce and create roles. ...
    * Assign people to roles. ...
    * Never make one-off changes. ...
    * Audit.

1. If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?
    The difference between authentication and authorization is: Authentication: proves users are who they say they are. Authorization: permits users to access certain tools, data, or areas on a network

2. Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.
   The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments.

3. Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.
    Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is the new permissions model in Microsoft Exchange Server 2010. With RBAC, you don't need to modify and manage access control lists (ACLs), which was done in Exchange Server 2007 and earlier. On the flip side - as with anything new, RBAC can seem a bit intimidating at first.
