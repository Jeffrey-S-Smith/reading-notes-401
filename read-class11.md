1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

Event-driven programming is used to synchronize the occurrence of multiple events and to make the program as simple as possible. The basic components of an Event-Driven Program are: A callback function ( called an event handler) is called when an event is triggered.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

Object oriented programming focuses on performing actions and manipulation of data that is encapsulated in objects within a sequential series of steps while event driven is more dynamic and relies on event triggering and event handling to determine the sequencing of the program.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Once we start a Node. js server, it initializes the variables and functions and then listens for the occurrence of an event. Event-driven programming is used to synchronize the occurrence of multiple events and to make the program as simple as possible.
