# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (often referred to as DSA) are fundamental principles in computer science. Throughout this course, you will be given new code challenges and will be required to whiteboard out the solution as well as implement a code solution.

This represents a shift in general complexity and weight from what you have experienced to this point in 201 and 301.

In order to prepare yourself, here are a few short readings and videos to give you some foundational knowledge. As you read and watch the content below, focus on the higher level concepts. We will be requiring a more detailed understanding of these as you progress through the course.

## Discussion Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
  You want to choose a data structure for your program you need to  consider these factors: The size of the data. The size of the storage. The data dynamics, such as changing or editing the data.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

    To prevent infinite recursion, you need at least one branch (i.e. of an if/else statement) that does not make a recursive call. Branches without recursive calls are called base cases; branches with recursive calls are called recursive cases. Functions can also be mutually recursive.

* This reading is foundational knowledge Data Structures and Algorithms. Data Structures and Algorithms for javascript are a set of programming instructions, known as inputs and outputs, that allow a data operation to function precisely at every execution. JavaScript data structures are a method of organizing and storing data in a computer for efficient access and modification when necessary.
